N=int(input()) #take the size

Array=list(map(int, input().split(‘ ‘)[:N]))

#input()—takes input
How do I take 'N' number of an input array in Python 3?


If you enter 1 2 3 4 5 it is taken as ‘1 2 3 4 5’

#split(‘ ‘)—splits the string into sequence of elements means converts whitespace #into commas (,)

#split function applicable only for string data type

#[:N]—slicing method it takes only up to N #even if user enters more than N numbers

#map— takes 2 arguments 1st one is a function and 2nd one is sequence of numbers

#It maps sequence of numbers to a function,

#i.e, it applies function to each element in the sequence

#Here it is performing typecasting operation #why we need this because in python by #default input is taken as string so we need to #convert it to int/float format.

#list— this is the container to store the elements. It is a mutable data type means we can add elements in the middle of this array and modify the elements which are already available

Example:

l=[1,2,3]

l[0]=4# works perfectly no error

# but in immutable type like tuple,string,int etc. We cannot modify the available elements and we cannot add in the middle

Example:

t=(1,2,3)

t[0]=3# this gives an error we are trying to modify the elements which are already available

t.append(4) # this works bcz we are adding elements at the end so no problem
